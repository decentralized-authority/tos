# Provider Terms of Service for Decentralized Authority Shared Services

These Provider Terms of Service ("**Provider Terms**") are entered into between you ("**Provider**") and Phaos LLC ("**Decentralized Authority**", "DA", "we", "us", or "our") in relation to your participation in a Shared Service offered by DA. By participating as a Provider, you agree to be bound by these Provider Terms, the Decentralized Authority Terms of Service for DA Users, and any other rules or policies that we adopt and publish from time to time.

## Shared Services

DA offers various Shared Services, such as, but not limited to, Community Chains (CC), which allow Providers to participate by running DA software to serve DA customers. Providers generate a share of the revenue from DA customers by running DA software.

### Participation as a Provider

1. **Provider Obligations.** Providers are subject to the same Terms of Service as DA users (since they are using DA software to participate in a Shared Service).

2. **No Guarantee of Payments.** DA does not guarantee payments for participating in a Shared Service. DA may provide payment estimates to Providers, but those are non-binding. DA provides payment at their own discretion. Providers join a Shared Service at their own risk.

3. **No Responsibility for DA User Activities.** DA is not responsible for how DA users use Shared Services. DA may, or may not, monitor user activity on a Shared Service, so Providers join at their own risk.

4. **Right to Exclude Providers.** DA reserves the right to exclude anyone wanting to be a Provider.

5. **No Guarantees.** Providers join a Shared Service as is with no guarantees.
